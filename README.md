# e-MitraSmartAgent

Problem Statement : 

Existing approach of e-Mitra has following limitations seen so far.
- Geographical limitations
	Citizen can avail the service only through e-Mitra outlets. Means the area where e-Mitra outlets are not setup.
	People will not get benefit of all those programmes.

- Time limitations
	As the e-Mitra outlets are bound by the time, Citizen does not get 24x7 service for the programmes.
	
- Time consuming
	As population outnumers e-Mitra outlets. Citizen of Rajasthan usually spend much time in queue and the process of offline registration.
	
- Not Environment Friendly
	Current approach was not purely GoGreen initiative based, hence there used to be paperwork for the services they availed.
